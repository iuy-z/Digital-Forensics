## **14. Making a Rooted Android Emulator**  
Building a **custom rooted Android emulator** for forensic research and malware analysis, allowing unrestricted access to **system partitions, hidden files, and app permissions**.  

## **15. iPhone Analysis with Autopsy**  
Performing **iOS forensics** using **Autopsy** to extract data from an **iPhone backup**, analyze app logs, recover deleted messages, and investigate **iCloud sync artifacts**.  

## **16. Windows and Linux Machines**  
Investigating **Windows and Linux systems** by analyzing **event logs, system processes, network configurations, and user activity logs** to detect unauthorized access or malware infections.  

## **17. Velociraptor Server on Linux**  
Deploying **Velociraptor**, an open-source **endpoint monitoring and forensic analysis tool**, on a **Linux server** for real-time system monitoring and incident response.  

## **18. Investigating a PUP with Velociraptor**  
Using **Velociraptor** to analyze **Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs)**, identifying hidden installations, tracking execution behavior, and detecting unauthorized system modifications.  

## **19. Investigating a Bot with Velociraptor**  
Detecting and analyzing a **bot infection** using **Velociraptor**, identifying **malicious process injections, C2 server communications, and automated scripts** running on a compromised system.  

## **20. Investigating a Two-Stage RAT with Velociraptor**  
Tracking a **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** using **Velociraptor**, analyzing its **multi-stage execution**, persistence mechanisms, and data exfiltration techniques to understand the attack chain.
